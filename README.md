+ Explanation of Project
- Utilizes a neural network founded upon the genetic algorithm to train the program to determine the optimal path for the car traversing through oncoming car traffic. 
- Implements parallelization to optimize and quicken the training of the genetic neural network. 
- Simulates collision detection with segment intersection and artificial sensors. 


+ Modifications Made
- Added variation to color of oncoming car traffic
- Changed the GUI
- Added comments to code for clarity
